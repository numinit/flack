## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Workaround for automatic C library input propagation in downstream Nix builds. ([#27] by [@roberth])
- `EvalStateBuilder::load_ambient_settings()` to control whether global Nix settings are loaded. ([#36] by [@roberth])

### Fixed

- Path coercion failing with "path does not exist" errors due to missing `eval_state_builder_load()` call. ([#36] by [@aanderse])

### Changed

- Split `nix-bindings-util-sys` (which contained all low-level FFI bindings) into separate per-library `*-sys` crates. ([#27] by [@Ericson2314])
  This allows downstream crates to depend on just the low-level bindings they need without pulling in higher-level crates.
