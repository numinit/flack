# Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive,
and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the Flack
project. It applies to all "collaborative spaces", which are defined as
community communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches,
commit comments, etc.).

Note that this Code of Conduct is derived from the [Ruby Code of Conduct](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/).

* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
